I am a software engineer at [Sierra Wireless](https://www.sierrawireless.com). I work for the [AirVantage IoT cloud platform](https://www.sierrawireless.com/products-and-solutions/sims-connectivity-and-cloud-services/iot-cloud-platform/) on UI stuff in **React**, REST / GraphQL APIs in **Node.js**, **Golang** or **Clojure**, internal tooling, and cloud automation on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
