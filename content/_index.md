I am a software engineer at [Sierra Wireless](https://www.sierrawireless.com). I work for the [AirVantage IoT cloud platform](https://www.sierrawireless.com/products-and-solutions/sims-connectivity-and-cloud-services/iot-cloud-platform/) on backend stuff in **Clojure**, **Golang**, internal tooling, cloud automation on **AWS** and sometimes UI stuff in **React**.
