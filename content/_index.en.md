I am a backend and infrastructure developer at [Airnity](https://www.airnity.com) where I work on the internal developer platform in **Elixir** and **Golang**, cloud automation and architecture on **AWS** with **Kubernetes** and **ArgoCD**.

Outside of work, I mainly do **astrophotography** from my backyard whenever possible.
