### Origins

After comparing many static site generators I landed on HUGO. HUGO's templating language uses <a href="https://golang.org">go</a> for the logic, and includes a live server for local development. This site's details (experience, skills, personal info) are all still fed by a collection of JSON data files that decouples presentation from content, but is only generated once as part of the git push workflow.

### How it's delivered
This site itself is a static site generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO</a> from a git repository.

### About the theme
The theme is a customization based on [hugo resume](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume) theme which can be see on [Hugo theme site](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-resume/).
